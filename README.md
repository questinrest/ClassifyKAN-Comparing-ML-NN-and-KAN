## ClassifyKAN-Comparing-ML-NN-and-KAN

# Overview

This comparative study aims to explore and evaluate different approaches to classification tasks, focusing on traditional machine learning algorithms, simple neural networks (NN), and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). While neural networks have dominated many areas of machine learning, KAN presents a unique alternative that leverages function decomposition. Given that KAN is a less explored but promising method, I'm particularly interested in seeing how it stacks up against more commonly used models, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

In this study, the models will be tested on various datasets, starting with smaller tabular datasets like the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset and expanding to larger, more complex datasets over time. The comparison will be driven by standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, allowing for a fair evaluation of each model's predictive performance. Additionally, I'll be considering other factors, such as training time and computational resources, since KANs are known to be computationally expensive compared to neural networks and traditional machine learning models.

One of the core aspects of this study is understanding the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. KAN's complexity might limit its scalability, and this will be a significant area of focus as the dataset size and complexity increase. By comparing KAN with both machine learning algorithms and neural networks, I hope to identify scenarios where KAN offers a genuine advantage and where it may fall short.


# Future Work

As the study progresses, I plan to expand the analysis to larger and more complex datasets, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). This will provide deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of KAN when applied to various domains, helping to determine whether it can serve as a viable alternative to neural networks in practical, large-scale machine learning tasks.
